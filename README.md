For my about me page I used the project example as a basis for my page. I coded each section individually in HTML. Added CSS next and finished with Javascript.

// Nav bar

Nav bar is static. Also becomes a hamburger when viewed on smaller screens. Each link will scroll down to the specific section.

// Header

Made a static image background with text overlay. Image changes depending on size of screen.

// About

Used bootstrap grid to do a 2 column layout with lame information about myself.

// Skills

Used bootstrap carousel for the images. Pre-made stock images with text overlay in Photoshop because I didn't know how to otherwise. Shame on me.

// Quotes

3 rotating design/programming related quotes. They fade in and out and rotate based on some JS code using a counter and jQuery.

// Work

Used an API for a grid image system. Added an API for lightbox functionality for the images.

// Contact

Standard contact form held by a bootsrap grid. Made an ugly submit button.

// Footer

Added information on the bottom with social media links.



// Problems

I still have some problems with formatting when the screen is smaller. The hamburger menu doesn't disappear after clicking a link. Didn't know how to format the page correctly by setting a max width. Couldn't code own carousel, used bootstrap. Forgot to keep committing my work.

// Biggest wins

Getting carousel to work was a pain for me. Not sure why but it took a really long time. Biggest win is completing the page and viewing it as a whole. Would like to implement more transitional elements in the next page.
